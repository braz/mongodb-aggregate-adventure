Write a program that connects to a locally running MongoDB MongoD server
and prints the result of a pipeline that processes a stream of documents
through a number of stages.

Aggregation allows you to combine projecting, grouping, sorting, limiting,
and skipping.

In this first example, you will operate on an existing collection to find
who starred (the cast) in this selection of films that were set in San Francisco. This data was provided by the San Francisco Data project at https://data.sfgov.org at https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am

In this exercise, you will use the database '{bold}test{/bold}'
running on your localhost (127.0.0.1) in port 27017 and CREATE the collection '{bold}locations{/bold}' from the file 'locations.json' included in the data collection or available at . You can do this programmatically or you can use the commandline tool, mongoimport with the --jsonArray option.

Stage 1 - Create the database 'test' and then create the collection 'locations'.

Stage 2 - Insert the documents from the JSON file, 'locations.json'.

Stage 3 - Perform an aggregate operation on the records using the $project and the $unwind operators to retrieve the list of "cast" members for these films and return the output of this operation to the console.

Your answer to the exercise will be run against the official solution to ensure
that your query returns the correctly modified document.

This exercise assumes a running MongoDB on your local machine. This means
the connection string will again be {yellow}{bold}'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/'{/yellow}{/bold}. You will create the database and collection you will use for this exercise as part of the exercise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
HINTS:

In this exercise, you will need to use the `aggregation` framework and its operators to return the desired output. In this case you will create a pipeline using a projection on the cast field and then apply the unwind operator again on the cast field.
